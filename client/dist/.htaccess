  # IMPORTANT: Hostinger (Shared) usually manages the Node process mapping automatically 
  # via its own internal config if you use the Node.js selector.
  # Do NOT add Proxy ([P]) rules here as they are not supported on shared hosting.

  # We redirect everything to the index.js entry point handled by Litespeed/Passenger
  # But actually, Hostinger's default .htaccess for Node is often:
  # RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:XXXXX/$1 [P,L] (generated by their system)
  
  # Since we don't know the port, we should NOT override the root .htaccess with one that assumes 3000.
  # The safest bet for the User is to DELETE this file and let Hostinger regenerate it,
  # OR use a simple redirect to the index file if using the 'index.js' handler method.

  # However, if we want to serve the React App from Node, we just need Node to receive the request.
  # If the user setup "Application URL" to root, all traffic goes to Node.
  # So we should effectively have NO .htaccess in public_html that interferes.

  # Strategy: remove this file content or make it empty comments so it overrides nothing.
